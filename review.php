        An amazing pure  veg restaurant in the vicinity.  A must try for their latest addition of litti chauka and dal bhati churma. Wonderful addition to their already tasty menu.
The owners take care of their customer in a way no one can. They treat their customer with so much care and respond with a ever smiling face.this attitude adds glory to the tasty menu .
Overall a must visit.

        Pure veg restaurant. Clean ambience with light music. Veg cigar roll was good in starters and soups were tasty. We requested veg jalfrezi to be served in gravy form. Was not up to the mark. Kulchas were slightly burnt and were fat compared to normal kulchas that we eat elsewhere. Overall a decent restaurant .Chats and more deserts can be added

        Good place (at least one time try types) to have food, though it offers Veg only. Seems recently they added some chinese items (white page image). Reaching early here would help as there is practically no parking, so finding space could be a challenge. There is no lift and you have to take stairs from basement to 1st floor so be aware of that if you are going with older ones.

        If you're looking for pure veg, North Indian / Rajasthani food, this is a newly opened restaurant in Hennur main road. A good option to visit with friends & family. Good food, excellent service and the place is elegant. The good part is they were able to accommodate our request for customisation and offer Jain food.
